            <p>Hello my name is Carter Arnold and I live in Worland, Wyoming.
            A goal of mine is to go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when I turn 18.
            I am going to seminary and institute at the same time and love them both, even though they are very different.
            I also love playing soccer, ballroom dancing, and spending time with family. My favorite fruit would be either mangos,
             peaches, or strawberrys. Some of my hobbies are almost any kind of art including cooking and music, singing, 
             playing the piano or the guitar. Some of my favorite music artists are: The Piano Guys and Mat and Savanna Shaw.
             I am the oldest of five brothers and one 2 year old sister. 
             Some sports that I want to learn or play more are: tennis, pickleball and volleyball. </p>
