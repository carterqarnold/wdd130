            <p>Hello, my name is Carter Arnold and I live in Worland, Wyoming.
            A goal of mine is to go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when I turn 18.
            I am going to seminary and institute at the same time and love them both, even though they are very different.
            I also love playing soccer, ballroom dancing, and spending time with family.</p>
